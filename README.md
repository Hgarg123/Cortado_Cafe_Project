# Cortado_Cafe_Project
Mini Project on Cortado Cafe

A cortado is a beverage consisting of espresso mixed with a roughly equal amount of warm milk to reduce the acidity. The milk in a cortado is steamed, but not frothy and "texturized" as in many Italian coffee drinks. We wanted to bring an element of Spain, Portugal, Latin America where people can come to relax, indulge and be themselves in an environment to match.

 It provides an intense caffeine hit if that's what you want.
